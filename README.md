# Optimization

This Repository contain solutions for optimization problems. The main idea is to show an standarized and replicable way of solution for static and dynamic optimization problems. The expecterd result is that all the solution presented here could be replicable by anyone and could be used as a base for develop more complex solutions like applications and APIs to deliver fastly optimal solutions for different kind of clients.

##Dynamic Optimization
The **Dynamic Optimization** directory contain classic solutions for different dynamic (time variant) problems that are commonly present in different knowledge areas. 

##Static Optimization
The **Dynamic Optimization** directory contain classic solutions for different static (no time depended) problems that are commonly present in different knowledge areas. 

###Pdta:
*the word "classic" means that more stylized solutions like **Neural Networks** or other tools are not used to solve the problems, it just be focused in use tools like "Newton Methods", "Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions" and "Pontryagins's maximum principle". If you want to find more stylized implementations, take a look on [Data Science](https://github.com/JuanPChicaC/Data-Science) or [Machine Learning](https://github.com/JuanPChicaC/Machine-Learning) repositories.*
