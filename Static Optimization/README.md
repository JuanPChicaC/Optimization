# Static Optimization Folder

This repository going to contain all the optimization problems raised and solved by me.

### 1) Portfolio optimization Model

This Model was created by **Harry Markowitz** in 1952 *(Portfolio Selection, The Journal of Finance)*. It contain the solution of the optimal percentage of investment that each financial asset has in the way to maximize the investment or minimize the risk of all portfolio.

In this file you are going to see an alternative for the original optimization problem. The main objective is to find a optimal combination of assets that minimize the variance coefficient of all the portfolio. In finance terms, it means minimice the risk by each monetary unit that is expected to be returned from the portfolio.

In first place, the solution going to be presented for a portfolio compossed by 2 assets, it let the user understand the general problem. After that, the solution will be develoip for n assets portfolio.
